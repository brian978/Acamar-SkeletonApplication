SlimMVC-SkeletonApplication
===========================

Since the SlimMVC framework might change more then the application structure I decided to maintain the skeleton application in a separate repository.

## Requirements
- Acamar-PHP (https://github.com/brian978/Acamar-PHP/)
- SlimMVC (https://github.com/brian978/SlimMVC/)
- SlimFramework (http://www.slimframework.com/)


## How to install
You need to have 3 environment variables:
- ACAMAR_PATH
- SLIM_MVC_PATH
- SLIM_PATH
