SlimMVC-SkeletonApplication
===========================

Since the SlimMVC framework might change more then the application structure I decided to maintain the skeleton application in a separate repository.

The folder structure of the skeleton application (that is bundled with the wrapper) is a combination between ZF2's structure and Maven's. It is also compatible with the PSR-0 auto-loading standard.

## Requirements
- SlimMVC (https://github.com/brian978/SlimMVC/)


## How to install
You need to have 3 environment variables:
- ACAMAR_PATH
- SLIM_MVC_PATH
- SLIM_PATH
