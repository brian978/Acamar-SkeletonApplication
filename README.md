Acamar-SkeletonApplication
===========================

You can find a getting started guide [HERE](http://acamar.no-ip.biz/category/documentation/getting-started/)

What is the use of the skeleton application
===========================

The skeleton application acts as both a base structure for the applications that are built using the Acamar framework
as well as a demo application to showoff the capabilities of the framework when it comes to a web application. The
demo application has some CRUD operations as well that were done with the SqlQuery package from the AuraPHP library.

Notes
----------
1. The `Database` module was built for demonstration purposes only and it's not something that is part of the
of the framework and it will never be part of it. Because of this it will not receive updates unless a feature of
the framework requires CRUD operations in order to be showed off in the demo application.

2. The demo application that is contained within the skeleton application MAY contain code that DOES NOT follow
coding best practices.

3. Although the Acamar framework targets APIs web application with an UI was chosen for a demo application because it
uses more of the framework.
